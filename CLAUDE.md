# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Data Desktop is a Wails-based desktop application for personal data tracking and visualization. It consists of a Go backend with SQLite database and a React TypeScript frontend. The application allows users to track various types of personal metrics including DEXA scans, bloodwork, daily metrics, experiments, journaling, time tracking, and people CRM.

## Development Commands

### Primary Development
- **Development mode**: `wails dev -appargs dev` (uses DataDesktop-dev.db)
- **Build**: `wails build`
- **Frontend only**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- **Frontend build**: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- **Frontend lint**: `cd frontend && npm run lint`

## Architecture

### Backend (Go)
- **Main entry**: `main.go` - Wails application setup with dev/prod database switching
- **API layer**: `backend/api.go` - Contains all frontend-callable methods
- **Database**: `backend/database/` - SQLite with dynamic schema and relationships
  - `models.go` - Core data structures (Dataset, DataRecord, FieldDefinition)
  - `dataset_definitions.go` - Predefined dataset configurations
  - `dataset_sync.go` - Syncs predefined datasets to database
  - `repository.go` - Database operations
- **File handling**: `backend/file/` - Manages file uploads and storage

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Router**: TanStack Router with file-based routing in `src/routes/`
- **State management**: TanStack Store in `src/store/`
- **Components**: Organized by feature in `src/components/`
  - `data-table/` - Generic data table with editing capabilities
  - `data-form/` - Dynamic form generation based on field definitions
  - `charts/` - Recharts-based visualization components
  - `resuable/` - Reusable components to be utilize whenever possible
  - Feature-specific components in respective directories
- **UI**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Dynamic schema**: Datasets defined via JSON field definitions, stored as SQLite TEXT
- **Generic components**: Data tables and forms work with any dataset configuration
- **Relationship system**: Fields can reference other datasets with display field resolution
- **File handling**: Base64 files converted to local file paths, stored in app data directory
- **Security**: Optional PIN protection for private data viewing

### Database Strategy
- Development uses `DataDesktop-dev.db`, production uses `DataDesktop.db`
- Schema-less approach: field definitions stored as JSON, data stored as JSON in TEXT columns
- Relationships handled via JSON field references with runtime resolution

### Data Flow
1. Frontend forms submit JSON data to backend API methods
2. Backend processes files (base64 â†’ local files) and validates relationships
3. Data stored as JSON in SQLite with metadata (id, timestamps, dataset_id)
4. Frontend fetches processed data with resolved relationships for display

## Important Notes

- Always use `wails dev -appargs dev` for development to avoid using production database
- The application stores all data locally - no external services required
- File uploads are converted from base64 and stored in the app data directory
- Private data is protected by PIN but not encrypted in the database
