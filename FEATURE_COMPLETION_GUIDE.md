# Feature Completion Guide

This guide outlines the steps to "finish" a feature in Data Desktop, transitioning it from alpha/beta status to a fully released feature.

## Overview

When a feature is considered complete and stable, it should be properly integrated into the application with comprehensive documentation and user guidance. This process ensures a consistent user experience across all features.

## Checklist for Feature Completion

### 1. Remove Development Stage Indicators

#### Remove `developmentStage` prop from FeatureHeader
- **Location**: Feature route file (e.g., `/routes/feature-name.tsx`)
- **Action**: Remove the `developmentStage="alpha"` or `developmentStage="beta"` line from the `FeatureHeader` component

```tsx
// Before
<FeatureHeader
  title="Feature Name"
  description="Feature description"
  developmentStage="alpha"  // ← Remove this line
  helpText="..."
  storageKey="feature-key"
>

// After
<FeatureHeader
  title="Feature Name"
  description="Feature description"
  helpText="..."
  storageKey="feature-key"
>
```

#### Remove development badges from dashboard summaries
- **Location**: Dashboard summary components in `/features/dashboard/`
- **Action**: Remove any alpha/beta badges if they exist

### 2. Add Comprehensive Guide Information

#### Update FeatureHeader with guideContent
- **Location**: Feature route file
- **Action**: Add detailed `guideContent` array with step-by-step instructions

```tsx
<FeatureHeader
  title="Feature Name"
  description="Comprehensive description of the feature"
  helpText="Detailed explanation of how the feature works"
  helpVariant="info"
  storageKey="feature-key"
  guideContent={[
    {
      title: "Getting Started",
      content: "Overview of the feature and its main components..."
    },
    {
      title: "Basic Usage",
      content: "Step-by-step instructions for common tasks..."
    },
    {
      title: "Advanced Features",
      content: "Details about advanced functionality..."
    },
    {
      title: "Tips & Best Practices",
      content: "Helpful tips for effective usage..."
    }
  ]}
>
```

#### Guide Content Best Practices
- **Start with overview**: Explain what the feature does and its main sections
- **Include step-by-step instructions**: Cover common user workflows
- **Mention key features**: Highlight unique or powerful capabilities
- **Add context**: Explain how the feature integrates with other parts of the app
- **Include troubleshooting**: Address common questions or issues

### 3. Update Onboarding Modal

#### Add feature to onboarding steps
- **Location**: `/components/onboarding/onboarding-modal.tsx`
- **Action**: Add a new step to `ONBOARDING_STEPS` array

```tsx
{
  title: "Feature Name",
  description: "Brief description of what the feature does.",
  icon: <FEATURE_ICONS.FEATURE_NAME className="h-12 w-12 text-primary" />,
  features: [
    "Key feature 1 with specific benefits",
    "Key feature 2 with user value",
    "Key feature 3 with unique capabilities",
    "Integration with other features",
    "Privacy/security aspects if applicable",
  ],
},
```

#### Update welcome step
- **Location**: Same file, first step in `ONBOARDING_STEPS`
- **Action**: Add the feature to the overview list in the welcome step

```tsx
features: [
  "Existing feature 1",
  "Existing feature 2", 
  "Your new feature description",  // ← Add this
  "Other existing features...",
],
```

### 4. Verify Help System Integration

#### Test info panels
- Verify any info panels in the feature work correctly
- Check that help text is informative and up-to-date

### 5. Update Documentation

#### Update CLAUDE.md if needed
- Add any new architectural patterns or guidelines
- Update examples if the feature introduces new concepts
- Add to relevant sections (routing, components, etc.)

#### Update README.md if applicable
- Add the feature to the main feature list
- Update any screenshots or descriptions

### 6. Final Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Functional testing
- Test all major workflows and features
- Verify error handling and edge cases
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes

#### Integration testing
- Test feature interaction with dashboard
- Verify navigation and routing work correctly
- Check that data persists correctly

#### User experience testing
- Go through the onboarding flow
- Test the help/guide system
- Verify the feature feels polished and complete

## Example: Wealth Feature Completion

Here's how the wealth feature was completed:

### 1. Removed Alpha Stage
```tsx
// Before
developmentStage="alpha"

// After
// (line removed)
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Guide
```tsx
guideContent={[
  {
    title: "Getting Started with Wealth Tracking",
    content: "The Wealth section is organized into four main tabs..."
  },
  {
    title: "Financial Logs - Track Transactions", 
    content: "Use the Logs tab to record all financial transactions..."
  },
  // ... more guide sections
]}
```

### 3. Updated Onboarding
```tsx
{
  title: "Wealth Management",
  description: "Comprehensive financial tracking for income, expenses, and net worth monitoring.",
  icon: <FEATURE_ICONS.WEALTH className="h-12 w-12 text-primary" />,
  features: [
    "Track all financial transactions with detailed categorization",
    "Monitor account balances across multiple institutions",
    // ... more features
  ],
}
```

## Tips for Writing Effective Guide Content

### Structure Your Guides
1. **Overview**: What the feature does and why it's useful
2. **Getting Started**: Basic setup and first steps
3. **Core Workflows**: Main tasks users will perform
4. **Advanced Features**: Power user functionality
5. **Integration**: How it works with other features
6. **Tips & Tricks**: Best practices and helpful hints

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Include specific button names and UI elements
- Explain the "why" behind actions, not just the "how"
- Use active voice and direct instructions
- Keep each section focused on one main topic

### Content Guidelines
- Each guide section should be 2-4 sentences
- Focus on user benefits and practical applications
- Include information about different modes (single/multiple/bulk entry)
- Mention keyboard shortcuts if applicable
- Explain privacy controls if the feature handles sensitive data
