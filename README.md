# Data Desktop

This application helps track any sort of data that I want to track. The current features implemented for tracking are the following:

- DEXA Scan information
- Bloodwork information
- Metrics that I want to be tracked
- Experiments tied to metrics that I want to be tracked
- Journaling that can be tied to metrics
- Time tracking that can be tied to metrics

The idea is to create a desktop application where all your data is stored locally, not encrypted, so that the user is able to aggregate any data they want to track.

Application is built for my own personal use, but may be useful to others if they want to follow the same process used by the application. Here are some considerations when using the application:

- DEXA Scan information is using data from BodySpec scans
- Bloodwork information requires you to input your blood markers before anything. This is because multiple lab providers have different bloodmarker names for the same blood marker. You have to decide which one you want to use and then track it accordingly
- For metrics and experiments, it's been tested to use true/false values. The other inputs have not been tested yet
- For journaling, the idea is to do those actions if only to give some time for yourself to reflect and also exercise some thinking muscles
- Time tracking is for you to understand how much time you spend on what task
- We recommend you add a PIN if you want to track data that should be private if you have the application opened, but leave the computer for a while, and you don't want people to look at it
  - Although visually, the data seems to be protected, if someone accessed your database, they will be able to view it

This application will be optimized as I find it a pain to do certain actions. Thanks for checking out the application!

- NOTE: Desktop application was created with a LOT of help from Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Some creative decisions were made by me, a lot were made by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. A lot of putting the code together is put together by me. (Unfortunately, Claude 3.7 Sonnet/Claude Code is still like a junior engineer that needs help occasionally to make things nice.)

## How to use

- For development, use `wails dev -appargs dev`
  - It will generate a `DataDesktop-dev.db` to use for development mode
  - WARNING: If you do not use `-appargs dev`, it will use the production database
  - If developing on Linux, use `npm run dev` at the root directory instead

## Project management

### TODOS

- create end to end test to make sure the inputs are all working correctly
- when I press the power button, it has this error: `This wails.localhost page canâ€™t be found No webpage was found for the web address: http://wails.localhost/dexa`, and it only happens sometimes - might be a wails bug?
- Add multi-relations work for table view, add/viewing/editing/importing (really, just need a overall tag multi feature since I think that's the only thing I'll be using multi-relations for for now)

- find a better solution when using wails to do dev/prod for the databases

- add a "version history note" to the application
- create a script that looks into the github log history, and extracts it into a file for the user to parse and clean up, it will create files according to logs before the "bump to 0.0.x" version git commits and put it into a "version_history" folder

- low priority bug: in daily tracker view, when you hover over a day, it still shows the incorrect data
- low priority bug: in time tracker, the pomodoro/break logic basically stops the pomdoro, then it shows a default add time entry view, then it goes to break mode
- low priority bug: make the markdown CSS better looking

- refactor out icons used in application into lib.ts
- refactor application to use reusable components

- add inventory management system
- add a "taking current supplements" section
  - allow user to select supplements based on what's in inventory
- make a "chores" functionality, see if todos or metrics would be a good spot to place this in, idea is to create a task, and then the task will stay there until the user completes it, and then it will continue on with the usual timeframe, but also allow the user to push the task a few days/weeks/months and adjust it moving forward (similar to the calendar applications)
- add a people crm feature (in progress)
  - in people crm feature, make a "make a meeting" where the user is allowed to select multiple users, and also create new simple users really quickly in that add form view
- add a "daily journal" that is able to do like "@feature" for tracking metrics
  - also adding templates for the user to be able to select that is added to the journal

- PDF reports from data
- in bloodwork, for reports, provide a table where a user can copy/paste their "out of range" markers to be used in a LLM

- see if there's an easy to migrate data from one computer to the other, or if there's a way to have a sync service easily managed (where the data stored in the backend is end to end encrypted)

### IN PROGRESS

- add a finance tracking section
- add a paycheck part in this section, along with the logs and balances
- when adding single form, is there a way to disable the "saved local data" part?
- in bulk import for the wealth section, add an import button with the fields required

- in reusable dialog, is there a way to allow for the custom content to have a dedicated footer that always shows at the bottom of the dialog? In addition, is there a way to also enabled that for the default footer?

- in metrics, add a way to manage the metric category
- rename "quick metric logger" to be just "metric logger"
- in experiments, when attaching a metric, also allow the user to create a metric there
- in experiments, when attaching a metric, make it easier for a user to search for an already created metric
- in experiments, if an experiment doesn't have an end date, don't show the progress bar or make something that signifies that ongoing
- in experiments, add a field for starting goal images and end goal images
- in time tracking/journaling dashboard summary, make it use reusable summary
- bug: in experiment dashboard summary, if the experiment is not private, it still shows the private
- in experiment dashboard summary, if the experiment doesn't have an end date, it shouldn't show the progress bar
- in bloodwork dashboard summary, can you allow the user to select bloodmarkers to be shown in there, a max of 5?
- in the dashboard summary configuration, there's the idea of small/medium/large for width, but can we also have the concept for small/medium/large for height? And if the content is too much for the size, make the content inside scrollable

- Add an export CSV button [DONE 2025-04-04]

- It seems like the input forms in single edit/multi edit in data-table isn't working [DONE 2025-04-06]
- refactor the data fetching code so that it all loads in one component, and also gets stored in TanStack store, and when there's modifications to data, it mostly just edits it on the client-side (still need to go through bloodwork components, and also updated `batch-entry-table` and `editable-cell` stuff with the relational fields) (might also try adding the TanStack store functions in the `ApiService`) (it looks like the reason why it's not displaying correctly is because the loading of data is not working correctly) [DONE 2025-04-07]

- in experiment-dashboard.tsx, combine the header components together [DONE 2025-04-13]
- in metrics, add a way to customize when the metric will show up (i.e. monday/wednesday) [DONE 2025-04-13]
