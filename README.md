# Journaling Desktop

- Desktop application was created with a LOT of help from Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Some creative decisions were made by me, a lot were made by Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

## Project management

### TODOS

- Currently, database has duplicate datasets, probably because it was initialized with old datasets that need changing
- PDF reports from data
- Pagination is not working in table component
- When you add an item, have it open up the view data tab
- Add multiple data entries as an option
- Make the add data section save a local copy
- Add a clear button to add data section
- In add data section, add a "cancel" button
- In view data, when you click on an item, have it also have a delete and clear button
- In view data, remove the edit and delete button, and make the delete button where the import csv button is (also that button doesn't work)
- In view data, make the items also selectable, so that if I click a checkbox, for multiple items, I can delete all of them at the same time
- Also make the edit section in view data be saved locally
- When finished editing or clicked cancelled, remove data for the edit section and the add data section

### IN PROGRESS
