# Data Desktop

This application helps track any sort of data that I want to track. The current features implemented for tracking are the following:

- DEXA Scan information
- Bloodwork information
- Metrics that I want to be tracked
- Experiments tied to metrics that I want to be tracked
- Journaling that can be tied to metrics
- Time tracking that can be tied to metrics

The idea is to create a desktop application where all your data is stored locally, not encrypted, so that the user is able to aggregate any data they want to track.

Application is built for my own personal use, but may be useful to others if they want to follow the same process used by the application. Here are some considerations when using the application:

- DEXA Scan information is using data from BodySpec scans
- Bloodwork information requires you to input your blood markers before anything. This is because multiple lab providers have different bloodmarker names for the same blood marker. You have to decide which one you want to use and then track it accordingly
- For metrics and experiments, it's been tested to use true/false values. The other inputs have not been tested yet
- For journaling, the idea is to do those actions if only to give some time for yourself to reflect and also exercise some thinking muscles
- Time tracking is for you to understand how much time you spend on what task
- We recommend you add a PIN if you want to track data that should be private if you have the application opened, but leave the computer for a while, and you don't want people to look at it
  - Although visually, the data seems to be protected, if someone accessed your database, they will be able to view it

This application will be optimized as I find it a pain to do certain actions. Thanks for checking out the application!

- NOTE: Desktop application was created with a LOT of help from Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Some creative decisions were made by me, a lot were made by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. A lot of putting the code together is put together by me. (Unfortunately, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is still like a junior engineer that needs help occasionally to make things nice.)

## Project management

### TODOS

- PDF reports from data
- Add multi-relations work for table view, add/viewing/editing/importing (really, just need a overall tag multi feature since I think that's the only thing I'll be using multi-relations for for now)
- it would be nice if the options I chose for table view stayed when I updated a value
- update how the multiselect looks like in both data-form and data-table, right now it doesn't look good
- add a way in the backend to make a field unique
- add a way to cascade the deleting of a relation, i.e. if a bottom level relation is going to be deleted, do you also want to delete the lower level relations?
- for quick metric logger, on a calendar, allow the user to select however many metrics, and in the calendar, it will highlight that metric in a different color (automatically assigned) for the user to visually see when they did the metric
- in quick-metric-logger, improve the button layout for hide from calendar, edit/delete
- in bloodwork add inputs, add virtualization
- create end to end test to make sure the inputs are all working correctly
- see why the line chart doesn't show the x data for the one right next to the last x data description
- in the metrics data model, for customization, add a way to specify when a metric will show up, it could be that the metric repeats every x days, weeks, or months starting on a specific date
- when I press the power button, it has this error: `This wails.localhost page canâ€™t be found No webpage was found for the web address: http://wails.localhost/dexa`, and it only happens sometimes - might be a wails bug?
- make the dashnoard able to be in like "specific card heights and card widths" or just hardcode it in
- add a way to enable/disable certain features from showing
- add a way to select the database you want to use
- update icons for the datasets

### IN PROGRESS

- add time tracking, and also tie it with a metric if possible
- in time tracking, in entries, show the category
- in time tracking, display a calendar view of the day of time tracking, and also a weekly view
- add a "time tracking" button at the header, and make it easy to track time, and make it reusable, so if I click in header, it pop ups, while also in the page, it can be used like normal
- allow the user to add a time entry without a description
- make the description kind of autocomplete
- tie time tracking and allow a user to select a metric to tie it to, to complete, metric can only be metric type time, so it should filter only for that metric, that's active
- when the datasets are loading on the dashboard page, show a visual indicator somewhere that it's loading and the user can't do anything while it loads
- adjust how the metric looks like for value number
- in daily tracker calendar view, it shows the dates in the wrong weekday slot
- in quick-metrics-logger, add a way to add notes
- in quick-metrics-logger, have a way to show the inactive metrics
- make the markdown CSS better looking
- in same question answers, only show the current day's question
- in question journaling, in the history list, for the filters, just provide the questions as a filter and allow the user to select it
- for some reason,, in daily tracking, the journaling metrics are not being categorized correctly
- in daily tracker dashboard summary, if the metric is a number, make it a better input (maybe a +/- and show the value?)
- add journaling information to onboarding modal and help modal
- add time tracking information to onboarding modal and help modal
- add time tracking info panel information

- Add an export CSV button [DONE 2025-04-04]
- Currently, database has duplicate datasets, probably because it was initialized with old datasets that need changing (looks like they are UUID dataset ids? so need to go into the datasets to find them in order to remove them) [DONE 2025-04-05]
- In `index.tsx`, modify the url so that if a dataset.id has `blood`, it goes to `bloodwork` [DONE 2025-04-05]
- Change bulk import into a button that opens a modal/ just made it an extra tab [DONE 2025-04-05]

- It seems like the input forms in single edit/multi edit in data-table isn't working [DONE 2025-04-06]
- refactor the data fetching code so that it all loads in one component, and also gets stored in TanStack store, and when there's modifications to data, it mostly just edits it on the client-side (still need to go through bloodwork components, and also updated `batch-entry-table` and `editable-cell` stuff with the relational fields) (might also try adding the TanStack store functions in the `ApiService`) (it looks like the reason why it's not displaying correctly is because the loading of data is not working correctly) [DONE 2025-04-07]

- bloodwork graphs, when I click "out of range", it still shows the "no range set" values [DONE 2025-04-12]
- in daily-tracker-calendar-view.tsx, the savechanges function needs updating - sometimes the log attaches to an experiment, but sometimes it doesn't [DONE 2025-04-12]
- in experiment-dashboard.tsx, combine the header components together [DONE 2025-04-13]
- in metrics, add a way to customize when the metric will show up (i.e. monday/wednesday) [DONE 2025-04-13]
- only show a metric log if the metric was created on the date of or after [DONE 2025-04-13]
